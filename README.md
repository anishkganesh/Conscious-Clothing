# hackPHS_2020 
This is our project that we had submitted at the hackPHS_2020.

A program that explains the climate impact you make when you buy a certain fashion item. So that consumers can buy responsibly and help the environment. The user pastes the link of the product and it calculates the amount of climate impact it makes.
We are adding a QR code scanner to scan the tags of clothes to check the climate impact they make and then we also want to add a reccommended section showing you better and more climate consicous alternatives to the clothing in the link you paste.
STAY TUNED FOR ALL THAT !!!
